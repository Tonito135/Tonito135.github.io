I'm learning Software Engineering because I want to have the flexibility to do what I want with my future. I enjoy being able to create something, and show it to the world. It helps me with my problem solving, and critical thinking of not just code, but everything in general; how to do such task at work easier, or quicker. I've always looked at how sites are built and have always said, "I can do it better". Little do I know it's not an easy task at all.
