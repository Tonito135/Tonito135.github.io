This project, has not been easy at all! I've spent days going to sleep at 3-4am coding, trying to make things work, trying to undertand why does this go here. Oddly enough, I spent these sleepless nights coding, but it was a really fun project. The first day I started on the project, I couldn't find something that I was passionate about. It took some searching, and A LOT of breaks. Throughout those breaks I would often catch myself watching baseball. While I was watching, that gave me the idea of doing something related to the statistical side of things in baseball. 

That first night was not easy. After I had gathered my thoughts, and planned out how I wanted to do this, I was immediately stuck. I said, "How in the world am I supposed to even go about this". Thank goodness the video on daily deal really helped out a ton. As a matter a fact, I wanted to code so badly, it was around 4:30 am and I couldn't fall asleep because of how excited I was. When I started working through it I began to realize I was too ambitious in my efforts and wasn't even sure of how to even go about it. This is when I scaled back drastically to only giving a couple players instead of a whole 28 man roster. To be fair, it was an awesome idea, but I just wanted to keep it simple.

Overall this project has been fun, and i've refreshed a lot of the stuff we've gone over, and learned a bunch more through other dev sites, and a ton of freaking Youtube. At some point, I do want to come back to this code and give it a go with the 28 man roster.
